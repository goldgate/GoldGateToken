The context of Goldgateâ€™s birth
Recently, many more ICOs have been issued with their own corresponding product launches. There appears to be an ICO and MLM frenzy across the Blockchain industry.

Although there are genuine products and judiciously executed ICOs, many disadvantages of weak setups have occurred, which hardly succeed in the business performance of their lending capital, such as:

+ Not having a lending business strategy, using capital of last-investors gives payout for pre-investors.

+ Weak technology: Most ICO sites have met serious challenges regarding data & bandwidth protection. There have been attacks (ddos) to steal data & capital of investors, which cause major damage & loss of finance and investment opportunities.

+ Website runs slowly, and sometimes is totally disrupted. It is risky when investors can no longer access it anymore.

+ Thin support system: Feedback from support requests is not given in time or sufficiently.

So why is GOLDGATE given birth to at this time? Anyone can understand that an investment would be unreasonable unless the risk of loss is manageable.
